## Setup
### Prerequisites
- PyTorch 1.0
- python 3.6.4
- Torchvision 0.4
- numpy and so on
### Data
- train data
- validation data
- test data

## Training
Training a network with default arguments. Model checkpoints and tensorboard logs are written out to a unique directory created by default within experiments/models and experiments/logs respectively after starting training.
If conditions permit, it will be better to pre-train the model first.
```javascript 
python main.py
```

## Validation and Testing
You can run validation and testing on the checkpointed best model by:
```javascript 
python test.py
```
